In order to use Vagrant tool to have to create local linux environment in a windows computer (Windows 10 in my case),
below is the general process that Iâ€™ve adopted after learning the fundamentals and working through some trial and error.
Follow these steps, editing any necessary information specific to your individual needs, and you should be up and running 
with Vagrant in about 15 minutes or less!

    1.Install VirtualBox > https://www.virtualbox.org/
    2.Install Vagrant > https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads
    3.Create a local directory for Vagrant
    4.Create a Vagrantfile in your newly created directory
    5.Run vagrant up and provisioning your virtual machine

Once you have installed them make sure that 'Hyper-V' is disabled on your computer as it may create an conflict
with virtualbox and thus give you issues. 

To disable 'Hyper-V',from elevated  command prompt:

bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off   ---  to disable hypervisor
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto  ---  to reenable it (default value).
OR
From Powershell (run as administrator) run >Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All 

Of course you'll need to restart your computer after running commands from either of the steps above.
