Vagrant's basic commands

All commands should be executed inside the VDD directory.

    $ vagrant ssh

    SSH into virtual machine.
    $ vagrant up

    Start virtual machine.
    $ vagrant share

    Share your virtual machine to the world via a temporary and unique url.
    $ vagrant halt

    Halt virtual machine.
    $ vagrant destroy

    Destroy your virtual machine. The source code and the content of the data directory will remain unchanged. Only the VirtualBox machine instance will be destroyed. You can build your machine again with the 'vagrant up' command. This command is useful if you want to save disk space.
    Warning: this command will destroy your site databases. Backup them using drush sql-dump > db.sql for each site.
    $ vagrant provision

    Reconfigure the virtual machine after a source code change.
    $ vagrant reload

    Reload the virtual machine. Useful when you need to change network or synced folder settings.
