For single OS installation:
Once you're all set then create a directory/folder in your computer by any name you prefer which will be your 
main folder where you will initiate and create vagrantfile.
Open elevated command prompt or run powershell as administrator and go to the directory that you just created.

you'll now add the OS box from: https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search by this command:
>vagrant box add 'xxxx (name of your linux OS)'

when this adding is successful,initialize it by this command:
>vagrant init 'xxxx(name of your OS)'.

After that run:
>vagrant up and it will create the environemnt and have your OS installed and ready on your provider which is
virtalbox.

If you come across any version mismatch error the you'll need to stop the OS by this:
>vagrant halt.

You can easily fix it by installing this plugin:
>vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest and your issues should be fixed.

Now you'll reboot your OS bythis command:
>vagrant reload.

Connet to your OS by this command:
>vagrant ssh and you should be into your linux OS.
